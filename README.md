# equilibrator-api

A command-line API with minimal dependencies for calculation of standard thermodynamic potentials of biochemical reactions using the data found on [eQuilibrator](http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/). 

# Current Features 

* Example scripts for singleton and bulk calculations.
* Calculation of standard Gibbs potentials of reactions.
* Calculation of standard reduction potentials of half-cells.

# dependenceis:
- python 2.7
- numpy (preferably >= 1.12.0)
